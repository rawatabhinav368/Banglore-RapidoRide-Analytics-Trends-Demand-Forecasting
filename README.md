### Project Overview

The project aims to analyze and forecast ride-sharing trends for Rapido in Bangalore, focusing on understanding user behavior, predicting ride demand, and deriving actionable business insights to improve operational efficiency.

### Data Sources 

**Dataset Source:**

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the **"rides_data.csv"** [Download rides_data.csv](https://github.com/rawatabhinav368/Hospital-Supply-Chain-Inventory-Optimization/blob/main/inventory_data.csv) file, which was downloaded from Kaggle's [Bangalore Rapido Ride Services Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishaldeoprasad/bangalore-rapido-ride-services-dataset?select=rides_data.csv).  This dataset contains detailed information about Bangalore Rapido Ride Services, including the following features:

- * ### Date - year-month-day
- * ### Time - Hour-Minute (HH:MM)
- * ### Ride Status - Indicates whether the ride was completed or canceled.
- * ### Service - Type of service offered (e.g., Bike, Car, etc.).
- * ### Source- The origin or pickup location of the ride 
- * ### Destination - The destination or drop-off point for the ride
- * ### Duration - The duration of the ride in minutes.
- * ### Ride id - A unique identifier assigned to each ride.
- * ### Distance- The distance traveled during the ride, measured in kilometers.
- * ### Ride charge- The base fare for the ride, excluding any additional charges, in local currency.
- * ### Misc charge - Additional charges for the ride (e.g., taxes, service fees), in local currency.
- * ### Total fare - The total fare for the ride, including all charges (Ride charge + Misc charge).
- * ### payment method - The payment method used for the ride.

  ### Data Cleaning/Preparation

  In the initital data preparation pharase, we preformed the following tasks:
  
  1. Data Loading and inspection 
  
  2. Checking for missing values -

* There was 5036 null values in our data set, for all cancelled ride (ride_charge	misc_charge	total_fare	payment_method) it shows NaN. 
  A canceled ride does not incur any charges, so filling 0.
* No transaction occurred, "Not Applicable" is a meaningful label for payment method.
* Created canceled column : 1 for canceled rides, 0 for all other rides.

  ### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 
  EDA involves exploring the inventory data to answer key questions, such as:

  - Which service type (e.g., Bike, Auto, Cab) is most preferred by users?
  - What are the peak demand hours for each service type?
  - How do service preferences change throughout the day or week?
  - What proportion of rides are completed versus canceled?
  - Which payment methods are most popular among users?
  - How strongly are features like distance, duration, and fare related?
  - Are there specific periods that contribute significantly to revenue spikes?
  - 

### Data Analysis 

Including some intresting code/features worked with 

```python
# Distribution of numerical columns (like duration, distance, ride_charge, etc.)
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
numerical_cols = ['duration', 'distance', 'ride_charge', 'misc_charge', 'total_fare']
rapido_data[numerical_cols].hist(bins=20, figsize=(12, 10))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

SARIMAX Forecast for ride demand 
rom statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX

# Ensuring we only pass the univariate 'ride_count' column
endog = demand_by_hour['ride_count']

# Step 1: Fit a SARIMAX model
# Example SARIMAX model: (p=1, d=1, q=1) and seasonal order (P=1, D=1, Q=1, s=24) for daily seasonality
sarimax_model = SARIMAX(endog, 
                        order=(1, 1, 1),  # ARIMA order (p, d, q)
                        seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 24))  # Seasonal order (P, D, Q, s)

# Step 2: Fit the model
sarimax_results = sarimax_model.fit()

# Step 3: Get the forecast for the next 24 hours
forecast_steps = 24
forecast = sarimax_results.get_forecast(steps=forecast_steps)
forecast_values = forecast.predicted_mean



# Creating a plot for the historical data and forecast
fig = go.Figure()

# Adding the historical data
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=demand_by_hour['hour'], y=demand_by_hour['ride_count'],
                         mode='lines+markers', name='Historical Demand'))

# Adding the forecasted data
forecast_index = np.arange(len(demand_by_hour), len(demand_by_hour) + forecast_steps)
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=forecast_index, y=forecast_values,
                         mode='lines+markers', name='Forecasted Demand', line=dict(color='red')))


fig.update_layout(title="SARIMAX Forecast for Ride Demand",
                  xaxis_title="Hour of the Day",
                  yaxis_title="Ride Count",
                  showlegend=True)

ARIMA Forecast for ride demand
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Step 1: Prepare the data
# Group ride counts by hour
demand_by_hour = rapido_data.groupby('hour').size().reset_index(name='ride_count')

# Ensure the index is set properly for time series modeling
demand_by_hour.set_index('hour', inplace=True)

# Step 2: Fit ARIMA model
# Example ARIMA order (p=1, d=1, q=1)
model = ARIMA(demand_by_hour['ride_count'], order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Step 3: Forecast future demand
forecast_steps = 24  # Predict for the next 24 hours
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=forecast_steps)
forecast_index = np.arange(demand_by_hour.index[-1] + 1, demand_by_hour.index[-1] + 1 + forecast_steps)

# Step 4: Visualizing the forecast using Plotly
fig = go.Figure()

# Historical demand
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=demand_by_hour.index, y=demand_by_hour['ride_count'],
                         mode='lines+markers', name='Historical Demand'))

# Forecasted demand
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=forecast_index, y=forecast,
                         mode='lines+markers', name='Forecasted Demand', line=dict(color='red')))


fig.update_layout(title="ARIMA Forecast for Ride Demand",
                  xaxis_title="Hour",
                  yaxis_title="Ride Count",
                  showlegend=True)

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
* High demand for bike services during early mornings, auto and cab demand peaks in the afternoon and evening.
* Ride counts fluctuate over time, with consistent peaks during specific periods.
* Paytm and GPay are the most popular payment methods, possibly influenced by promotions.
* Bike services are the most preferred, offering consistent ride durations, while auto and cab services show more variability.
*  ARIMA and SARIMAX models suggest growing demand with daily fluctuations.

  ## Recommendations
* Increase bike availability during morning hours and prioritize auto/cab services in the evening.
* Promote bike services as a cost-effective, quick option for short-distance travel.
* For auto and cab services, focus on improving ride consistency by reducing variability in ride durations (e.g., through better route optimization or partnerships with local authorities to reduce traffic bottlenecks).
*  Capitalize on Paytm and GPayâ€™s popularity by offering time-limited discounts to further drive engagement.
*  Promote premium cab services during evenings for social outings or corporate travel to attract higher-paying customers.
